            <h2>MISSION STATEMENT</h2>
            <br />
            With the development of HTML5, there are now a ton of new tools and   resources that can be utilized by Web designers to explore various   untouched possibilities. HTML5, even though considered a <em>&ldquo;work-in-progress&rdquo;</em> by <a href="http://www.w3.org/" target="_blank">W3C</a>,   is gaining support within many major web browsers such as Firefox,   Chrome, Opera and Safari. However even with these developments, a   majority of the users (including myself) have not yet attempted to   capitalize with the new version of HTML and do not understand its true   capabilities.<br />
            <br />
            TH-HTML5 is a community project opened to anyone (new or old) who has   any interest in exploring the aspects of HTML5 and expanding their, as   well as others', knowledge towards creating a site employing its new   abilities.<br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <p><strong>Our Goal is Simple</strong><br />
              <em>&ldquo;To create an appealing and useful demo site that incorporates as   many features of HTML5 as possible, all the while, utilizing as many   members as possible in its creation. We hope in this process that we   will be able to learn more about HTML5 and that our Demo Site will   provide examples and give explanation to all its future uses.&rdquo;</em></p>
            <br />
            To reach this goal, we will discuss the features of HTML5 amongst   ourselves, investigate and research the possibilities of these features   in action, and incorporate them in our site's final design. The hopeful   end result of this project, besides allowing us to learn HTML5   effectively, is some kind of website design that uses as many HTML5   Features that we can find an accurate purpose for and  that validates   with W3C. Creating an excellent example of what HTML5 can do in the   future. <br />
