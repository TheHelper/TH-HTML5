            <h2>Mission statement</h2>
            
            <p>With the development of HTML5, there are now a ton of new tools and resources that can be utilized by web designers to explore various untouched possibilities. HTML5, even though considered a
            <em>&ldquo;work-in-progress&rdquo;</em> by
            <a href="http://www.w3.org">W3C</a>, is gaining support within many major web browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, Opera and Safari. However even with these developments, a majority of the users (including myself) have not yet attempted to capitalize with the new version of HTML and do not understand its true  capabilities.</p>
            
            <p>TH-HTML5 is a community project opened to anyone (new or old) who has any interest in exploring the aspects of HTML5 and expanding their, as well as others', knowledge towards creating a site emplying its new abilities.</p>
            
            <h3>Our Goal is Simple</h3>
            
            <p>To create an appealing and useful demo site that incorporates as many useful features of HTML5 as possible, all the while, utilizing as many members as possible in its creation. We hope in this process that we will be able to learn more about HTML5 and that we will be able to learn more about HTML5 and that our Demo Site will provide examples and give explanation to all its future uses.</p>
            
            <p>To reach this goal, we will discuss the features of HTML5 amongst ourselves, investigate and research the possibilities of these features in action, and incorporate them in our site's final design. The hopeful end result of this project, besides allowing us to learn HTML5 effectively, is some kind of website design that uses as many HTML5 features that we can find an accurate purpose for and that validates with W3C. Creating an excellent example of what HTML5 can do in the future.</p>
